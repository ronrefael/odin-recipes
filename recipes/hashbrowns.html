    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These hash browns are inspired by the classics from McDonald’s, but with a twist–they’re stuffed with melty cheese! They
        are fun to whip up and serve to a crowd, but are also easy to freeze and reheat in the oven for breakfast on the go!

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>canola oil, for frying</li>
        <li>2 lb frozen hash brown, thawed</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>24 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>ketchup, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Fill a large, deep pan halfway with canola oil and heat over medium heat until the temperature reaches 350°F (180°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the hash browns, eggs, salt, pepper, paprika, and flour. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scoop a heaping tablespoon of the hash brown mixture onto a clean surface and shape into a rectangle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place two slices of cheddar cheese in the center, then top with another tablespoon of the hash brown mixture and shape
            into a rectangle, sealing the cheese inside. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a large spatula to transfer 2 hash browns at a time to the hot oil and fry for 2–3 minutes, or until golden brown.
            Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and season with more salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve immediately with ketchup for dipping, or let cool completely, wrap in foil, and freeze for up to 3 months. To
            reheat, unwrap and bake in a 400°F (200°C) oven for about 20 minutes, flipping once, until warmed through and golden
            brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Enjoy!
        </li>
